### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2022

+ Projec title: Philosophy Texts Analysis
+ This project is conducted by [Chen Chen]

+ Project summary: I analyzed the length of sentences of different philosophy texts from different philosophers, followed by a sentiment analysis and clustering of emotions. Then I created two word clouds from two philosophers, trying to figure out their main focus in philosophy.
